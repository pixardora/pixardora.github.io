Current DH projects are mostly based on large scale datasets. As a beginner, the first problem I met was: where does one find such data? Moreover, I realized I wasn't even sure what kind of data I needed, as my thinking hadn't yet shifted to a data-centric approach. Thus, my approach to digital humanities is more "bottom-up": rather than pursuing DH for its own sake, I try to find out how it could help my _existing_ projects, how it could answer my questions in a new way.
