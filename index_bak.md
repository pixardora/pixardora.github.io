<!-- ## Just a place to locate my notebooks. -->

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies. I study history of medicine, science, and the environment. I enjoy doing fieldwork in western China, mainly the Upper Min River region in Sichuan province. I am currently writing a monograph on the life stories of medicine gatherers of Chinese medicines.
